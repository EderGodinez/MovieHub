## Table Sprint Review

| What was done well? | What can I do differently? | What didn't go well? |
----------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------
| Relearn my knowledge in Angular | Work a little more efficiently plus I could have avoided creating some components with the use of templates and containers | I couldn't complete the 100% of code coverage because I had several problems with the testing of the primeng p-toast component  |
